/**
 *  @brief Caluclates the conductance for water vapor flow between the leaf
 *  surface and the atmosphere (AKA, the boundary layer conductance) using a
 *  model described in Thornley and Johnson (1990).
 *
 *  This model considers gas flow due to wind-driven eddy currents. Here, the
 *  conductance is calculated using Equation 14.9 from pages 414 - 416 of the
 *  Thornley textbook. Unfortunately, an electronic version of this reference is
 *  not available.
 *
 *  In this model, the minimum possible boundary layer conductance that could
 *  occur is zero, which would correspond to zero wind speed or canopy height.
 *  In realistic field conditions, boundary layer conductance can never truly be
 *  zero. To accomodate this, an option is provided for setting a minimum value
 *  for the boundary layer counductance.
 *
 *  This model contains two singularities, which occur when either of the
 *  following conditions are met:
 *
 *  - `WindSpeedHeight + Zeta - d = 0`, which is equivalent to `CanopyHeight =
 *     WindSpeedHeight / (dCoef - ZetaCoef) = WindSpeedHeight * 1.34`
 *
 *  - `WindSpeedHeight + ZetaM - d = 0`, which is equivalent to `CanopyHeight =
 *     WindSpeedHeight / (dCoef - ZetaMCoef) = WindSpeedHeight * 1.56`
 *
 *  So, as the canopy height approaches or exceeds the height at which wind
 *  speed was measured, the calculated boundary layer conductance becomes
 *  unbounded. For even larger canopy heights, the conductance eventually begins
 *  to decrease. For tall crops, this is a severe limitation to this model. Here
 *  we address this issue by limiting the canopy height to
 *  `0.98 * WindSpeedHeight`.
