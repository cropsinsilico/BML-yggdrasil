skelBML version 2.1.3 (https://github.com/biocro/skelBML)

Created by Justin M. McGrath, Edward B. Lochocki, and Scott Rohde.

The skeleton BioCro module library (skelBML) is a framework for creating an R
package. Running the setup script on a copy of this repository will create a
basic BioCro module library R package with a single example module. Then,
additional modules can be added. See `docs/README.md` for detailed instructions
explaining how to do this. For more information about BioCro and BioCro module
libraries, see the BioCro R package (https://github.com/biocro/biocro) and
Lochocki et al. (2022) (https://doi.org/10.1093/insilicoplants/diac003).
